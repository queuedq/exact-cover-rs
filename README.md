# exact-cover-rs

(WIP) Asynchronous exact cover solver library using Knuth's dancing links algorithm.

This library is working in progress and the API is highly likely to be changed. Please use other libraries such as [dlx](https://crates.io/crates/dlx) or [dancing-links](https://crates.io/crates/dancing-links) for the time being.
